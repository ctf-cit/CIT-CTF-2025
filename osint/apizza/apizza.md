## Solution

The picture is a Google Earth screenshot of Frank Pepe's Pizza in New Haven. However, running `exiftool` against the image reveals a set of coordinates that lead to the Skull and Bones secret society building in New Haven which was the flag. Note that the flag had a few acceptable formats which were not listed below.

```
GPS Latitude                    : 41 deg 18' 29.88" N
GPS Longitude                   : 72 deg 55' 48.00" W
GPS Position                    : 41 deg 18' 29.88" N, 72 deg 55' 48.00" W
