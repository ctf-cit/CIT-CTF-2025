# Remember the welding challenge from last year? 

I got a job at this oil rig doing some pipe welding. I need a new welding helmet and I think I found a good one..

There is someone selling one on the 'ole Ebay just like this, but I'm going to see if the 'ole feller will let me pick it up in-person. While I'm out there.. maybe I'll grab a bite to eat. My per diem at the new job allows me to fine dine, so maybe I'll check the 'ole Michelin Guide and see what is going on in the area with some Bib Gourmands..

Now that I'm looking... I'm in the mood for a really good Chicken Tikka. Any ideas on where I can find one a bit West from the seller's area?

**Flag format will be the restaurant's name wrapped in `CIT{}`**

## Solution

The challenge image was an absolutely bombshell welding mask with a beautiful graphic of the Joker and a roulette wheel.

The challenge description mentions Ebay which is a big hint on where to exactly look deeper. Reverse image searching this challenge file, you will come across a few similar masks.

The specific Ebay listing was [this](https://www.ebay.com/itm/134801016021?_skw=welding%20helmet%20joker&itmmeta=01JSVZ65HZ99PREPWDWS326QB3&itmprp=enc%3AAQAKAAAA8FkggFvd1GGDu0w3yXCmi1fF0rdij2wF7QOpJEQO5eY%2Brf6q2baoMEh941YT%2FRXg5FJ3rfwSvbGQh2Hidb4saVeSi6NbxyCcqoIQNGKx75C%2FIdQa0LbmX78Roi%2FIgVN1OFwjy0UrW5XeWwWidmH9W2qCGWipVPr0dNMG40CTsO74VYd4xiNZ9XUkSIXIMVoqOUScXL4J5u7ae6159IP83spLaCUOFAClHjBl1wh4L7luPZ6MXfr%2BFqSrNh9VLg3WZ4Wn0VqisB%2FnH%2BZ8OqTBkD3impSLBpLQSR9tUh7y%2BQC2BCX4Rn8CzfK8S31z6JMgew%3D%3D%7Ctkp%3ABk9SR5rZmP_OZQ&LH_BIN=1) one here.

Looking at the details of the listing, you can see the seller is based in Ontario, California. The challenge mentions the Michelin Guide, Indian food, and Bib Gourmands, which are cheaper alternatives to Michelin starred restaurants. Looking at guide for Bib Gourmands near Ontario, you will come across an Indian restaurant named **Manohar's Delhi Palace** which is the flag.
