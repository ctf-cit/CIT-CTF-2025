Deceive you, the bytes do. Look deeper, you must.

**SHA256:** `b3ca30e35e55e20406c278eb5accdb78ef028b001837f2bfaadda5760943f7f3`

## Solution

For this challenge, if you run `exiftool yoda` you will see the following warning which tells you the file is a JPEG:

```
Processing JPEG-like data after unknown 1-byte header
```

Using a tool like `ghex` you can also see the endianness of the file is swapped. From there, you can either write a script, use CyberChef to render the image, or use a quick one-liner command.

To solve this challenge using CyberChef, use the following recipes in this exact order:

> **To Hex > Swap Endianness > Render Image**

Upon doing so you will see the image of LEGO Yoda which contains the flag.

To Solve using a one-liner command:

> `hexdump -v -e '1/4 "%08x"' -e '"\n"' yoda | xxd -r -p > yoda.jpg`

Once you open the outputted image, you will see the flag

## Flag

`CIT{h1dd3n_n0_m0r3_1t_i5}`
